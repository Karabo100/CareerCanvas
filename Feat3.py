#This feature allows for the retrieval of job postings from the Adzuna API. The user can specify the job title and location to search for job postings. The function retrieve_job_postings(app_id, app_key, what, where) takes in the user's app_id, app_key, job title, and location as arguments and returns the job postings in JSON format. If the request is successful, the function returns the job postings; otherwise, it prints the status code and response text of the request. The user needs to replace '<YourAPPId>' and '<YourAppKey>' with their own Adzuna API app_id and app_key to use this feature.
